To get it, you need to right click normal [Farmland](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Farmland) with Arcane Bone Meal. Magical Farmland doubles the quantity of crop drops. Golden Orchids can only grow on this type of Farmland.

### **Black Hole**

You can create a Block Hole by throwing Dark Matter together with Corrupti Dust on the ground. It will attract items and small entities like [Arrows](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Arrow) or [Experience Orbs](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Experience) and delete them. Once it absorbed enough experience points, it will throw out a [Xpetrified Orb](../items/#xpetrified-orb).
