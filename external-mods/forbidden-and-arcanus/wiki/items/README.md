Blacksmith Gavels are a new tool type like Pickaxes or Shovels. Just like Pickaxes they can be used to mine stone-related blocks at a higher speed. Furthermore, they have pretty high attack damage making them a viable weapon, though, at the cost of a lower attack speed.

Every Gavel has a remaining ritual uses counter in their tooltip that shows how many rituals this item can still be used for. More advanced Gavel variants can be used more often.&#x20;
