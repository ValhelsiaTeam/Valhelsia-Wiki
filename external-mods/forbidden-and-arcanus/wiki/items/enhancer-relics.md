# Enhancer Relics

Currently, there are seven different Enhancers implemented that can be found by exploring the world. Each one has one or multiple effects that will help you advance quicker or improve your setup.&#x20;

Some Enhancers are not accessible in survival mode right now. The methods of obtaining them will be implemented in future updates. We decided to include them nonetheless to give modpack authors the chance to already use them in a creative way if desired.&#x20;

Furthermore, their uses are currently unlimited. In a future update, we intend to add a renewable way of acquiring them. Once this happens, they will receive a use limit.
