Cherrywood tree generate frequently in [Plains](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Plains) biomes. Their wood makes a great building material.

Aurum trees only generate in the [Flower Forest](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Forest#Flower\_forest) biome. Their leaves sometimes contain gold nuggets which drop when harvested.

### <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Edelwood Log (1).png" alt="" data-size="line"> <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Carved Edelwood Log.png" alt="" data-size="line"> **Edelwood**

Edelwood Trees only naturally generate in [Dark Forest](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Dark\_Forest) biomes. Their unique appearance consists of a hollow log that is up to four blocks high. The top part always has a face carved in it. On the side up to two Edelwood Branches might generate. When destroyed these Branches will drop an Edelwood Stick.&#x20;

Smelting an Edelwood Log will result in the creation of Dark Matter.

From time to time Edelwood Logs might get oily. You can collect this oil using an empty [Glass Bottle](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Glass\_Bottle) and craft it into [Black Dye](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Black\_Dye).

The small leaves that the Carved Edelwood Log has can be removed by using a shear on the block.  If you want them back you might want to use [Bone Meal](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Bone\_Meal) on the log without leaves.

Alternatively to finding Edelwood Trees you can also create your own. Everything you need is a Dark Soul and an [Oak Sapling](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Sapling#Oak\_Sapling) or a [Dead Bush](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Dead\_Bush). Simply right-click the Sapling or Dead Bush with the Dark Soul and it will transform into a Growing Edelwood. After some time this special kind of sapling will grow into a full Edelwood Tree.

It's a decoration for the moment that you can place by right-clicking (it may have a utility in a future update).
