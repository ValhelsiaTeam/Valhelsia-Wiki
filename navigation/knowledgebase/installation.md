We support the below launchers to play Valhelsia packs. Choose one of them and follow the instructions provided. Other launchers may work, but we don't officially support them.

## <mark style="color:orange;">ATLauncher</mark>

{% hint style="info" %}
Third-party Minecraft Launchers can no longer automatically download all of the mods in our modpacks due to changes made by CurseForge (as of May 2022). You will need to manually download several mods (and/or resource packs) when using ATLauncher.
{% endhint %}

:inbox\_tray:[ ATLauncher Download](https://atlauncher.com/downloads)

1. [Download](https://atlauncher.com/downloads) and Install ATLauncher. Use the _Setup (Recommended)_ button if you are unsure which version to download.
2. Open ATLauncher, then select _Accounts_ on the right. You will need to add your Mojang / Microsoft account in order to play.
3. Once you have logged in and can see your account name at the bottom of the window, select _Packs_, then _CurseForge_.
4. Search for the pack you wish to install, then select it and click _New Instance_.
5. Select the version of the pack to install (leave it on the default if you are unsure), and click _Install_.
6. Part way through the installation of the pack you will be notified that some mods (or resource packs) are not available. After downloading the other mods, ATLauncher will guide you through manually downloading these files to your Downloads folder. There is an _Open All In Browser_ button that makes this process easier.
7. Once the pack has installed, select _Packs_, then click _Settings_ to change the [Allocated Memory](allocating-memory.md) to at least the minimum required for the chosen pack. Click _Save_ when done.
