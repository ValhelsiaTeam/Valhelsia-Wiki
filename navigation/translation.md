### :pencil: How to get started:

1. Register (or sign in) at [https://translate.valhelsia.net/](https://translate.valhelsia.net/)
2. Fill in your profile.
3. Select the language on the project page for which you want to offer your translation.
4. Then click `Join` next to the "You must join the translator team to be able to participate in this project." message.
5. A member of the Valhelsia Team will verify your application and accept it.
6. Go to the editor by choosing a file to translate.
7. Fill in the box to propose your translation or vote for a translation from another translator.

{% hint style="info" %}
When the box is already filled, it means that a translator has already translated the string. If the box is not filled, click on it and suggest your translation (if you are not sure don't do it and let another translator translate it). If you believe a translation is incorrect or could be improved, you can fill the box with your own translation (if the old one is already validated by a member of the Valhelsia Team, it will be put in the list of suggestions and will have to be validated by a manager in case it gets enough votes).
