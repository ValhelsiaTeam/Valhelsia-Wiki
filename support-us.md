# Support Us

## <mark style="color:orange;">Introduction</mark>

Players have been asking for a while if we accept donations. While we truly appreciate the interest, our current approach is to provide recognition back to the people who support us financially. Consequently, at this moment, we do not have a direct donation option available but several options are on the table.

However, there are alternative ways for you to support us. We've partnered with serious companies to bring you products that may be of interest. The revenue received from our partners will go towards allowing us to continue the ongoing development of Valhelsia projects, and we greatly appreciate this indirect support received.

### Free support

You can also help us to translate our mods and modpacks, find more information on the [page](navigation/translation.md) dedicated to this subject.

Finally, for those who can't spare the money, there are non-financial ways to support us too - things such as streaming our packs, creating videos, or sharing screenshots; playing with friends; or being active on our Discord server all help us, and we appreciate you all greatly.
